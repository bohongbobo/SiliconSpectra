1. Explain JS feature and basic execution mechanism.

2. Why we need to avoid Global Variables and Functions?
	Because Global Variables can be overwritten easily by other variables.

3. How to keep a Strict Coding Style?

4. Give an example of camelCase.
	helloWorld

5. Why reduce access to variables and properties?

6. Implicit coercion_1: `console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3)`
	false

7. Implicit coercion_2: `console.log(1 + '2')`
	12

8. Implicit coercion_3: `console.log(1 - '2')`
	-1

9. Implicit coercion_4: `console.log(1 * '2')`
	2

10. Implicit coercion_5: `console.log(1 % '2')`
	1

11. `NaN === NaN`?
	false

12. What are the primitive data types in JS?
	Boolean, null, undefined, number, string

13. What is immutable data?

14. What is the output?


		let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, false, null, undefined, , null, NaN, 0];

		arr = arr.filter(a => Boolean(a));

		console.log(arr);

			output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

15. Give some samples of Browser Object Model (BOM).

16. What is the difference between Null and Undefined
	Null is assigned value but means nothing, 
	undefined means the variable has been declared, but there is no value for it.

17. What are IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)?

18. What is the difference between anonymous and named functions?

19. Give a sample of ternary operator.

20. Tell me what's the difference between OOP vs FP in your own words.
